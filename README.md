## My Pixel Perfect Project
### By [JÃ¸rgen Lybeck Hansen](github.com/jeyloh)


Running Node v. 6.11.3


This branch consists of my side-project not really following the structure of master branch. I'm going to develop a
progressive web application in React, using Node as a server backend, eventually connecting to MongoDB and also learning
new React specific packages such as [react-router4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx).


Currently, this application is using the json provided in the master branch to demo some api calls. I'll try to update the readme
as I update the code.


Also, I'm going to add tests to the code, eventually. I rarely test projects which will be one of my main focuses in this project.
I'll also use it to learn specific tech for our certifications at Ignite Pixel Perfect.
